# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a lightweight spam email classifier that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to identify whether a given email message is **spam** or **not spam**. It’s built in a Jupyter Notebook with clean code and a user-friendly design — ideal for integration into web forms or internal tools.
